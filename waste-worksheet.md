Identifying software development waste worksheet
Often we can become accustomed to the wastes in our development process. For each question, reflect and look for wastes. For more details about software development wastes, see http://sedano.org/software-development-wastes/

“Are we delivering features that provide little value?”

“Is there a misalignment between User Desires and Business Desires?”

“Was there a time when the backlog did not reflect our understanding of the most important work?”

“Was there a time when the backlog did not reflect the current state of what everyone was doing?”

“Was there rework? e.g. defects, rejected stories, ambiguous stories, technical debt”

“Could we have simplified our solutions further?”

“What slowed your thinking down? e.g.
inefficient tools / APIs / libraries, complex stories, poorly organized code”

“Did you feel too much stress?” 

“Did you experience waiting?”

“Did you experience multitasking?”

“What knowledge is not shared?”

“Did you experience ineffective communication?”

“Did you experience ineffective meetings?”

“Is anything else slowing your team down?”
